# Git Conflict Check

Checked repository state on 2025-10-02 09:07:35Z.

- Current branch: `work`
- Working tree status: modified (conflicts resolved)
- Merge conflicts: **RESOLVED**

## Conflict Resolution Summary

### Resolved Conflicts
All merge conflicts between HEAD (work branch) and main branch have been resolved.

**Resolved Files:**
1. `lib/supabaseServer.ts` - Mock Supabase implementation
2. `lib/supabaseClient.ts` - Browser client implementation
3. `playwright.config.ts` - E2E test configuration
4. `tests/setupTests.ts` - Test setup file
5. `CONFLICT_CHECK.md` - This conflict tracking file

### Resolution Strategy

The conflict was between two different Mock Supabase implementations:

**HEAD branch** (`lib/testing/mockSupabase.ts`):
- Lightweight implementation for unit tests
- Environment variable: `MOCK_SUPABASE === "1"`
- Function: `isMockSupabaseEnabled()`

**main branch** (`lib/mockSupabase.ts`):
- Full-featured implementation for development and integration tests
- Environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_SUPABASE === "true"`
- More comprehensive CRUD operations and query builders

**Decision: Adopted main branch implementation**

Reasons:
1. More comprehensive feature set supporting all required operations
2. Better aligned with existing API routes and components
3. Consistent with project architecture
4. Single source of truth for mocking
5. Better developer and testing experience

### Implementation Details

All files now consistently use:
- Import: `import { createMockSupabaseClient } from "@/lib/mockSupabase"`
- Environment variables: `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_SUPABASE` and `USE_MOCK_SUPABASE`
- Check pattern: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_SUPABASE === "true"`

### Next Steps

1. Run test suite to verify resolution
2. Update any affected test cases
3. Commit resolved changes
4. Consider deprecating `lib/testing/mockSupabase.ts` if no longer needed

---

All merge conflict markers have been removed. The codebase is now consistent and ready for testing.
