# Git Conflict Check

Checked repository state on 2025-10-02 09:13:55Z.

- Current branch: `work`
- Working tree status: modified (all conflicts resolved)
- Merge conflicts: **RESOLVED**

## Conflict Resolution Summary

### Resolved Conflicts (Second Round)
All remaining merge conflicts between HEAD (work branch) and main branch have been resolved.

**Resolved Files:**
1. `lib/supabaseServer.ts` - Mock Supabase server implementation
2. `lib/supabaseClient.ts` - Mock Supabase browser client
3. `playwright.config.ts` - E2E test environment configuration
4. `tests/setupTests.ts` - Test setup and polyfills
5. `tests/e2e/workouts.spec.ts` - Workout E2E tests
6. `CONFLICT_CHECK.md` - This conflict tracking file

### Resolution Strategy

The conflicts stemmed from two different approaches to testing and mocking:

**HEAD branch approach:**
- Lightweight mock implementation in `lib/testing/mockSupabase.ts`
- E2E test bypass with `E2E_BYPASS_AUTH` flag
- Simplified test flows focusing on navigation
- Environment variable: `MOCK_SUPABASE === "1"`

**main branch approach:**
- Comprehensive mock implementation in `lib/mockSupabase.ts`
- Full E2E testing with complete CRUD operations
- Mock Supabase with query builders and complex operations
- Environment variables: `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_SUPABASE` and `USE_MOCK_SUPABASE`

**Decision: Adopted main branch implementation**

### Rationale

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full E2E tests provide better quality assurance
2. **Feature Completeness**: Mock implementation supports all required database operations
3. **Consistency**: Unified approach across development and testing
4. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for mocking logic
5. **Real-world Simulation**: Tests closer to actual user workflows

### Implementation Details

All files now consistently use:
- **Mock Module**: `import { createMockSupabaseClient } from "@/lib/mockSupabase"`
- **Environment Variables**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_SUPABASE` and `USE_MOCK_SUPABASE`
- **Check Pattern**: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_SUPABASE === "true"`
- **E2E Tests**: Complete workflow testing (create, read, update, delete)

### Files Modified

1. **lib/supabaseServer.ts**
   - Unified mock detection logic
   - Consistent import from `lib/mockSupabase`

2. **lib/supabaseClient.ts**
   - Browser-side mock support
   - Environment-based switching

3. **playwright.config.ts**
   - Removed `E2E_BYPASS_AUTH`
   - Added Mock Supabase environment variables
   - Standardized test environment

4. **tests/setupTests.ts**
   - Added Request polyfill for test environment
   - Import @testing-library/jest-dom

5. **tests/e2e/workouts.spec.ts**
   - Complete CRUD test flow
   - Mock API route interception
   - Full user journey testing

### Next Steps

1. âœ… All merge conflicts resolved
2. ðŸ”„ Run test suite: `npm test` or `pnpm test`
3. ðŸ”„ Run E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e` or `pnpm test:e2e`
4. ðŸ”„ Commit resolved changes
5. ðŸ”„ Consider deprecating `lib/testing/mockSupabase.ts` (if no longer needed)

### Verification

- âœ… Zero merge conflict markers remaining
- âœ… All files use consistent mock implementation
- âœ… Environment variables standardized
- âœ… E2E tests include complete workflows

---

**Status**: All conflicts successfully resolved. Codebase is consistent and ready for testing.
