# Git Conflict Check

Checked repository state on 2025-10-02 08:56:52Z.

- Current branch: `work`
- Working tree status: modified (lib/supabaseServer.ts resolved)
- Merge conflicts: **RESOLVED**

## Conflict Resolution Summary

### Resolved Conflicts
- **File**: `lib/supabaseServer.ts`
- **Date**: 2025-10-02 08:56:00Z
- **Conflict Type**: Merge conflict between HEAD (work branch) and main branch
- **Resolution Strategy**: Adopted main branch implementation

### Details
The conflict was between two different approaches for Mock Supabase implementation:
1. **HEAD branch**: Cookie-based mock session with Buffer encoding
2. **main branch**: Environment variable controlled mock using dedicated `mockSupabase.ts` module

**Resolution**: Chose main branch approach because:
- More modular and maintainable
- Uses existing `lib/mockSupabase.ts` with complete implementation
- Environment variable controlled (`NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_SUPABASE`)
- Better separation of concerns

### Final Implementation
```typescript
import { createMockSupabaseClient } from "@/lib/mockSupabase";

const useMockSupabase =
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_SUPABASE === "true" ||
  process.env.USE_MOCK_SUPABASE === "true";

export const createServerSupabaseClient = async () => {
  if (useMockSupabase) {
    return createMockSupabaseClient() as unknown as ServerSupabaseClient;
  }
  const cookieStore = await cookies();
  return createServerComponentClient<Database>({ cookies: () => cookieStore });
};
```

All merge conflict markers have been removed and the file is now consistent.
